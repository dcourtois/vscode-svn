# Introduction

For the poor souls out there stuck on Svn on Linux, here is a VSCode extension that should make their life a bit
easier. It provides an SCM provider that you can use inside Visual Studio Code to control your Svn controlled projects.

For the moment, it's not available in the Visual Studio Code extension 'market'. I'm still in the process of
learning typescript and VSCode extensions, and as such the extension is in its very early stage.
