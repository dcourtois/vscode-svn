# Introduction

For the poor souls out there stuck on Svn on Linux (so no TortoiseSVN) here is a VSCode extension that should make their
life a bit easier. It provides a SCM provider that you can use inside Visual Studio Code to work with your Svn controlled
projects.

For the moment, it's not available in the Visual Studio Code extension 'market'. I'm still in the process of
learning typescript and VSCode extensions, and as such the extension is in its very early stage.
